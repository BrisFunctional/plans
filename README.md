What do we get up to at BrisFunctional?
===============================

  Our aim is to spend an interesting evening once a month learning about something more-or-less related to Functional Programming.  Have a look at [our wishlist of upcoming topics](https://github.com/BrisFunctional/plans/wiki/Topics).

  It's free to come along. We meet on the last Tuesday of each month, 7pm at Nokia's Wine St office ([the middle door](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=wine+st+bristol&ll=51.455157,-2.592452&spn=0.007809,0.017273&safe=active&hnear=Wine+St,+Bristol,+United+Kingdom&gl=uk&t=m&z=16&layer=c&cbll=51.455212,-2.592273&panoid=dD_n1Q-tOBSUJi53cfog_g&cbp=12,313.71,,0,-1.23)).

  There's food & drink laid on by Nokia and we usually decamp to a pub to continue the discussion afterwards.

  So - come along and join in.  See you there?
